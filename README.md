# CodeCraft: Exercise Your Coding Skills üíª

This project draws inspiration from LeetCode.

## Current Status and Features 

- **List of Questions**: Currently, there are about 5 questions available for solving.
  
- **Fully Functional Real-time Code Submission**: The code submission and testing for any question work seamlessly. Currently, the code editor only supports JavaScript.

- **Efficient UI State Management**: UI state management is handled excellently using Recoil.js.


## Drawbacks/Problems to be Solved
- **Lack of Added Security Layer**: The JavaScript code entered by the user in the playground runs directly on the server without additional security checks to prevent malicious attacks.


## Future Upgrades and To-Dos 
- **Implement a Sandboxed Environment**: Create a sandboxed environment where user-submitted code is executed in isolation.

- **Expand Code Editor Language Support**: Enhance the code editor to support at least 3 languages, including C++ and Python.


## Tech Stack üõ†Ô∏è

- **NEXT.js**
- **TypeScript** 
- **Firebase**
- **Recoil.js**
